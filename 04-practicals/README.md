  - title: Taking power back to CSS

      Writing CSS is easy if you learn it. But maintaining it as it scales, is hard. The bigger the project becomes, the more complex your CSS gets. It gets split across different files, we will have redundant class names, and what about responsiveness. In most of the cases, you are not the only one working on that codebase so you are never really on the same page. I haven't listed down all the problems yet, these are just a few.
      Is there a solution to it? Well, yeah. Let's see how we can take the power back to CSS.
